### Hi there, I'm Constance!

I'm a new student at the University of Edinburgh, embarking on my MSc in Computer Science 💻🤓.
I'm excited to learn more about data, machine learning and computer graphics with the ambition of finding ways to combine those in biomedical applications!  

Aside from class, I love meeting people with ideas different from mine, which is why I am getting involved in the entrepreneurial world. I'm also an amateur (although certainly good) baker 🍰, a climber 🧗‍♀️, and a traveller 🌍.  

Here's to the many challenging and exciting projects to come!
